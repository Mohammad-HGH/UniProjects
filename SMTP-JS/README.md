## What Is an SMTP Server?

SMTP servers are complicated, and if youâ€™re just dipping your toe into the how-email-gets-sent world, itâ€™s easy to feel overwhelmed. To help you navigate your email sendingâ€”specifically, an SMTP server to send emailâ€”weâ€™ve put together a list of the most common SMTP server questions we receive, so youâ€™ll be an SMTP expert in no time.

What does SMTP mean? Weâ€™re glad you asked. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, and itâ€™s an application used by mail servers to send, receive, and/or relay outgoing mail between email senders and receivers.

An SMTP email server will have an address (or addresses) that can be set by the mail client or application that you are using and is generally formatted as smtp.serveraddress.com. For example, the SMTP server Gmail uses is smtp.gmail.com, and Twilio SendGridâ€™s is smtp.sendgrid.com. You can generally find your SMTP email server address in the account or settings section of your mail client.

When you send an email, with SMTP host Gmail or AOL, the SMTP server processes your email, decides which server to send the message to, and relays the message to that server. The recipientâ€™s inbox service provider, such as Gmail or AOL, then downloads the message and places it in the recipientâ€™s inbox.

#### Is an SMTP server the same as a normal server?

Technically, yes. Like most servers, the SMTP server processes data to send to another server, but it has the very specific purpose of processing data related to the sending, receiving, and relaying of email. An SMTP server is also not necessarily on a machine. It is an application that is constantly running in anticipation of sending new mail.
